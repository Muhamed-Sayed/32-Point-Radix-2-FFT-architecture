# 32-Point-Radix-2-FFT-architecture
Based on Cooley and Tukey algorithm

Digital signal processing needs the conversion from time domain to frequency domain. For discrete sequences, this conversion is done through Discrete Fourier Transform but it is numerically inefficient. Thus an efficient algorithm is developed to compute DFT and it is known as Fast Fourier transforms (FFT).In order to fulfill the requirements of executing precise calculations and less power & area consumption, an algorithm with less number of adders and multipliers is used.
